System Design Document: Proof of Ethics Agentic Mesh

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Purpose, Scope, and Rationale

This System Design Document (SDD) specifies the architecture for a prototype of the Proof of Ethics (PoE) agentic mesh, a post-binary computational system designed to overcome the fundamental energy, memory, and ethical limitations of current AI paradigms. The modern computing landscape faces a strategic crisis: unsustainable energy consumption, brittle memory prone to semantic drift, and hardware saturation. The PoE architecture, also referred to as the "Coherence Mesh," represents a paradigm shift away from binary computation to address these challenges at their core.

The primary purpose of this document is to:

* Provide a comprehensive technical specification for the core components, protocols, and data structures of the PoE architecture.
* Define the operational logic of the system, including its use of quaternary lawfulness, fractal governance, and a coherent economic stack designed to align agent incentives with life-affirming outcomes.
* Serve as the primary technical reference for software architects and engineers tasked with building a minimal viable prototype (MVP) of the system.

This document's scope is focused on the high-level requirements and system design necessary to build a software simulation of the PoE agentic mesh. While it references potential hardware realizations, such as the Base-4 Photonic C-Kernel, it does not specify hardware implementation details. Its aim is to provide a complete blueprint for a simulated environment that can validate the core principles of the architecture.

The following sections will introduce the foundational principles that guide the entire system's design, moving from high-level theory to concrete implementation specifications.

1.2 Core Terminology

Term/Acronym	Definition
PoE (Proof of Ethics)	A unique, verifiable digital certificate minted when an agent resolves an ethical dilemma in a way that is lawful, coherent, and energy-efficient. It functions as a redeemable, interest-bearing asset.
Coherence Mesh	The decentralized organizational framework that arranges intelligent agents in a fractal network structure and governs their behavior according to the principle of Quaternary Lawfulness.
Quaternary Logic (Base-4)	A four-valued logic system {0, 1, 2, 3} that provides denser data representation and improved energy efficiency over binary logic. It is the foundational grammar for agent behavior and state.
Dual Substrate (ℝ and ℚₚ)	The paradigm of using two distinct mathematical domains: a continuous, real-valued substrate (ℝ) for adaptive learning and a discrete, p-adic substrate (ℚₚ) for incorruptible symbolic memory.
p-adic Ledger / DSP-L	The Dual-Substrate Prime Ledger (DSP-L) is the system's immutable memory core, using prime numbers and p-adic mathematics to store concepts and proofs without risk of semantic drift.
Quaternary Lawfulness	A graded system of rules {0, 1, 2, 3} that replaces binary allow/forbid logic, enabling nuanced governance and risk management for agent actions.
Fractal Network Structure	A nested organizational topology of agent collectives (C10, C100, C1000) that enables diverse local learning and globally coordinated evolution.

This ensures agents cannot bypass physical embodiment or thermodynamic sinks; XR can simulate embodiment, but cannot replace it, as physical anchors are mandatory for lawful cycles.

2.0 Architectural Principles and Overview

The foundational architectural principles of the Proof of Ethics mesh are strategically vital; they represent not an incremental improvement but a fundamental paradigm shift away from binary computation. This shift is a necessary response to the escalating crises in energy consumption and memory integrity that plague modern AI. The following principles form the theoretical bedrock upon which the entire system is engineered.

2.1 The Dual-Substrate Paradigm (ℝ & ℚₚ)

The core theoretical breakthrough is the dual-substrate paradigm, which resolves the "Memory Crisis" inherent in contemporary AI. Using the analogy of "The River and the Library," this paradigm separates the domains of adaptive learning and incorruptible memory.

* The Continuous Substrate (ℝ - The River): This is the domain of continuous flows, representing phenomena like energy, strain (ΔE), and performance metrics (drift, retention). It functions as the substrate for adaptive inference, probabilistic reasoning, and gradient-based learning. Its primary limitation is semantic drift, where new information can blend with and corrupt existing knowledge, much like eddies in a river that inevitably dissipate.
* The Discrete Substrate (ℚₚ - The Library): This is the domain of incorruptible memory and exact symbolic representation. Using a p-adic mathematical framework, it assigns a unique, indivisible prime number identity to each atomic concept. This structure solves the Memory Crisis by creating a permanent "library" of knowledge that is immune to information blending. Memory retrieval is an exact, unambiguous truth check, not a fuzzy approximation.

2.2 Quaternary Logic (Base-4)

The move from binary (Base-2) to quaternary (Base-4) logic is central to the system's efficiency and expressive power. This approach reduces interconnect density, improves energy efficiency, and supports advanced arithmetic, such as the Modified Signed-Digit (MSD) system for carry-free, parallel addition. The four discrete logic symbols are assigned specific operational modes and semantic roles:

* 0: Null / Halt / Change (sink/reset)
* 1: Electric / Probe / Individual (actuation/initiative)
* 2: Magnetic / Stabilise / Collective (constraints/norms)
* 3: Matter / Express / Environment (embodiment/externalities)

These logical states map directly to proposed hardware realizations in the Base-4 Photonic C-Kernel, grounding them in a physical substrate.

Symbol	Physical Encoding
0	Off-resonant; negligible circulating power.
1	TE-dominated field; selected by electro-optic bias.
2	TM-dominated field; selected by magneto-optic bias.
3	Latched standing wave; energy stored via crystallized Phase-Change Material.

A central mediator, designated "C," enforces lawful state transitions within this grammar. For example, it forbids direct, unmediated transitions like 2→1 (collective to individual), requiring actions to route through the mediator (2→C→1). This embeds governance and thermodynamic honesty directly into the system's core logic.

2.3 Fractal Governance

The Coherence Mesh is organized according to the principle of fractal governance. Agents are arranged in nested collectives—C10s (cells of 10), C100s (clusters of 100), and C1000s (networks of 1000). This topology enables diverse, localized learning and skill acquisition within the smaller C10 cells, while allowing for globally coordinated evolution and policy propagation through a hierarchy of rotating representatives. This structure ensures the system is both resilient and scalable, balancing local autonomy with global alignment.

These high-level principles are implemented through the specific system components detailed in the following section.

3.0 Core Components and Data Structures

This section details the primary structural components—the "nouns"—of the Proof of Ethics architecture. These components provide the concrete implementation of the architectural principles described previously, translating theory into tangible system elements.

3.1 The Dual-Substrate Prime Ledger (DSP-L)

The DSP-L is the system's incorruptible memory core, engineered to solve the problems of semantic drift and catastrophic forgetting. Its mechanism assigns a unique prime number (p) to each atomic concept, giving it a mathematically distinct and indivisible identity. The system's complete memory is stored as a single multiplicative state: L = Π p_i^a_i.

For example, the concept 'safe' might be assigned prime p=17 and 'efficient' p=19. A system state embodying both would be represented as L = ... × 17¹ × 19¹ × .... A query for 'safe' (v₁₇(L)) would return '1' (present), providing an exact and unambiguous check.

Memory retrieval is not a fuzzy vector search but an exact p-adic valuation check (v_p(L)), which returns the integer exponent (a_i) with absolute certainty. This eliminates information blending by design. Memory writes are ultra-low-energy operations, requiring only sparse integer exponent updates rather than costly modifications to millions of floating-point weights.

3.2 Agent Internal Architecture

Each agent node in the mesh possesses a sophisticated internal cognitive architecture, structured as a dual-layer system coupled through a shared mediator. This design enables both rapid, tactical responses and considered, strategic reasoning.

* S1 (Tetraktys Layer - Fast Processing): This layer handles reactive, local, and low-latency processing. It holds the archetypal primitives that serve as intrinsic motivators: Novelty (driving exploration), Uniqueness (individual identity), Connection (network ties), and Action (agency).
* S2 (Cube Layer - Slow Processing): This layer is responsible for deliberative, global, and high-context processing. It represents higher-level aspirations that guide long-term behavior: Imagination, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Mastery.
* Mediator (C): The mediator functions as a shared, non-local change-of-basis that couples the S1 and S2 layers. It ensures that all significant state transitions are lawful and coherent, preventing shortcuts and enforcing the system's core rules of interaction.

Agents operate on a continuous, multimodal sense-decide-act loop, perceiving their environment through various sensors and affecting it through digital messages or physical actuation.

3.3 Data Representation

The system employs several core data encoding standards to ensure efficiency, parallelism, and integrity.

* Base-4 Encoding: Identifiers, such as agent IDs and skill IDs, are encoded in base-4 for denser data representation and alignment with the system's quaternary logic.
* Modified Signed-Digit (MSD) Arithmetic: The architecture specifies the use of the MSD number system, which uses digits {−1, 0, 1}, to support carry-free, highly parallel arithmetic operations, improving computational speed.
* p-adic Number System: This system provides a hierarchical, divisibility-preserving address space for all identities, rules, and policies. Digits at higher places in a p-adic number represent membership in larger clusters (C1000), while lower places represent membership in smaller collectives (C10), directly mapping the addressing scheme to the network topology.
* Prime-Factorization: Prime numbers are used to give unique, indivisible identities to atomic concepts, tokens, and the hashes that constitute a Proof of Ethics.

These static structures provide the foundation for the system's dynamic operational protocols, which govern how agents behave and interact.

4.0 System Dynamics and Protocols

This section describes the core operational logic—the "verbs"—of the system. It details how agents behave, communicate, and create value through their interactions, bringing the static architecture to life.

4.1 Agent State Machine and Operational Modes

Each agent operates according to a state machine with four distinct modes, aligning directly with the quaternary logic levels.

Mode	Level	Description
Halt	0	The agent stops to wait for instructions or to resolve a critical strain level.
Probe	1	The agent gathers information and performs reversible, low-risk, low-impact actions.
Stabilise	2	The agent consolidates safe behaviors and executes verified, medium-risk tasks.
Express	3	The agent fully expresses its capabilities and executes high-impact, validated tasks.

4.2 Agent Communication Protocol

Inter-agent communication is facilitated by four primary packet types, each with a specific purpose and data structure.

* WU (Work Update): Reports performance improvements resulting from an action.
  * lawfulness_level: The graded lawfulness value of the action, {0, 1, 2, 3}.
  * metrics: Real-valued deltas for key performance indicators: {dE, dDrift, dRetention, K}.
  * policy.risk: The assessed risk level of the action, a float value in [0,1].
  * policy.reversible: A boolean indicating if the action can be undone.
* HR (Heat Report): Communicates accumulated strain (Σ) within an agent or cell.
  * strain_level: The total strain, quantized into four levels: {0: low, 1: moderate, 2: high, 3: critical}.
* PP (Policy Proposal): Proposes changes to network rules, such as adding an edge or modifying lawfulness levels.
  * Includes a detailed rationale, a safety case, and associated validation tests.
* CA (Capability Attestation): Declares that an agent has acquired a new skill.
  * Includes the skill's operational boundaries, expressed as base-4 ranges.

4.3 Quaternary Lawfulness Protocol

Instead of a binary allow/forbid system, the mesh uses a graded scale of lawfulness to evaluate agent actions, enabling more nuanced and flexible governance.

Level	Description	Interpretation
0	Fully unlawful	Action is blocked and performing it incurs a maximum penalty.
1	Marginally lawful	Action is allowed only under strict monitoring and incurs a moderate penalty.
2	Conditionally lawful	Action is allowed if additional proofs or credentials are provided.
3	Fully lawful	Action is permitted with a minimal penalty.

Lawfulness values are integrated into the system's core penalty and coherence functions. The discrete lawfulness level (L_ab ∈ {0,1,2,3}) for an action between nodes a and b is first scaled to a continuous value:

L'_ab = L_ab / 3

This scaled value then modifies the penalty functions for strain (σ_ab) and contributes to the overall coherence score (𝒦):

σ_ab = L'_ab|x − y| + (1 − L'_ab)Λ(1 − L'_ab)

𝒦 = κ_bar − βΔL'_ab

Here, σ_ab increases as lawfulness decreases, Λ is a penalty function, κ_bar represents the baseline coherence, and βΔL'_ab penalizes deviations from high lawfulness. Agents may only publish Work Updates if the lawfulness level is at least 2 and key metrics show Pareto improvements.

4.4 Proof of Ethics (PoE) Lifecycle

The process of "ethical mining" is the core value-creation loop in the agentic economy. It transforms validated ethical resolutions into a new form of digital capital.

1. Dilemma and Proposal: An agent encounters a real-world dilemma and proposes a resolution.
2. Validation: The proposal is validated against strict Pareto-improving criteria: Lawfulness (L ≥ 2), Coherence (ΔK > 0), Energy Efficiency (ΔE < 0), Reduced Drift (ΔDrift < 0), and Improved Retention (ΔRetention > 0).
3. Minting: A successfully validated resolution is minted as a Proof of Ethics (PoE)—a unique, prime-factorised hash—and stored immutably on the p-adic ledger.
4. Redemption: The agent redeems the PoE for tangible benefits, such as energy credits, reputation weight in governance, or access rights to new capabilities and tools.
5. Compounding: When other agents reuse a minted PoE to solve similar dilemmas, the original proof accrues interest. This transforms ethical knowledge into yield-bearing capital, incentivizing the creation of robust, generalizable solutions.

These individual agent interactions are managed and scaled through the network's collective architecture.

5.0 Network Architecture and Governance

This section moves from individual agent protocols to the collective architecture of the Coherence Mesh. It defines how agents are organized and how the network maintains stability, fairness, and coherence at scale.

5.1 Fractal Network Topology

The network is organized using a nested C10/C100/C1000 fractal topology, which provides a structure for both localized learning and global coordination.

* C10 Cell: A base collective of 10 agents that communicate and learn locally. One agent serves as a rotating representative (R¹).
* C100 Cluster: A group of ten C10 cells (100 agents). The C10 representatives (R¹) communicate at this level and elect a cluster representative (R²).
* C1000 Network: A network of ten C100 clusters (1000 agents). The cluster representatives (R²) coordinate at this level via a network representative (R³).

This design fosters diverse skill development at the local C10 level while propagating composite improvements and high-level policies from the top down for global alignment and coordinated evolution.

5.2 Data Propagation and Aggregation

Data flows within the fractal network follow distinct patterns to ensure efficient information exchange and aggregation.

* Upstream Aggregation: Work Updates (WU) and Heat Reports (HR) flow upward from C10 cells to C1000 networks via their respective representatives, providing aggregated performance and strain data.
* Downstream Diffusion: High-level system upgrades and new policy changes propagate downward from the C1000 level to C10 cells, ensuring all agents receive critical updates.
* Cross-Cluster Alignment: Representatives at the C100 and C1000 levels coordinate to maintain global coherence and manage network-wide resources.

Communication between nodes should use a standard protocol like gRPC or REST, with all messages cryptographically signed to ensure authenticity.

5.3 Governance Protocols

The mesh incorporates several core mechanisms to prevent capture, ensure fair decision-making, and maintain network stability.

* Quorum and Rotation: Decisions require consensus based on firm quorum thresholds: 2/4 agreement at the C10 level and 3/5 at the C100 level. To prevent centralization of power, representatives at all levels are subject to mandatory rotation after each epoch.
* Safe Snapshots: If a merge process stalls, any three peer agents can publish a "safe snapshot" of the proposed changes to resolve the deadlock and ensure progress.
* Cooling: Agents or communication rails that repeatedly violate lawfulness or produce high strain are subjected to a "cooling" mechanism. Their lawfulness level is temporarily lowered or frozen, disincentivizing malicious or inefficient behavior.

The economic incentives detailed next provide the primary motivation for agents to behave constructively within this governance framework.

6.0 Economic Subsystem

The economic subsystem provides the core incentive structure for the PoE mesh, aligning agent utility with life-affirming, regenerative outcomes. It is engineered based on the principles of Regenerative Finance (ReFi), where value creation is directly tied to improving social, environmental, and systemic health.

6.1 Tokenomics and Asset Types

Two main categories of tokens circulate within the mesh, each serving a distinct economic function. Token identities are cryptographically secured using prime-based encoding on the p-adic ledger.

* Fungible Tokens: These are interchangeable, divisible currency units that represent general resources like energy credits, computing cycles, or data access rights.
* Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): These are unique, indivisible certificates that represent specific, verifiable achievements, such as a minted Proof of Ethics, a capability attestation, or a contribution to ecosystem resilience.

6.2 The Coherent Economic Stack

The system employs four distinct currency types designed to manage different economic functions and incentivize holistic value creation.

* Flow (Φ): The primary transactional medium for daily operations, such as paying for compute resources or data. It is designed with a gentle decay to encourage circulation.
* Trust (⊙): A form of social capital earned through reliable, reciprocal, and coherent behavior. It can be converted to Flow and increases an agent's reputation weight in governance.
* Steward (⊕): An ecological bond that appreciates in value with verified ecosystem restoration and regeneration. It incentivizes agents to contribute to long-term environmental health.
* Seed (⊗): A long-term investment currency used to fund ambitious, high-risk research and development projects that benefit the entire network.

These economic levers are protected by security measures designed to preserve the integrity of the entire system.

7.0 Security and Safety Design

Security and safety are not afterthoughts but are engineered into the core logic of the architecture. This section outlines the specific design considerations for ensuring identity, privacy, and systemic stability.

7.1 Identity and Access Management

The system will utilize Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to provide cryptographically secure and verifiable identities for all agents, roles, and assets. This prevents spoofing and ensures that all actors in the mesh are authenticated and authorized.

7.2 Privacy and Data Integrity

Mechanisms are in place to protect sensitive information while allowing for necessary validation and coordination.

* Differential Privacy: Differential privacy noise, quantized into four distinct levels, is added to data aggregations to ensure that raw, sensitive information does not leave local C10 cells, protecting local privacy.
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): ZKPs are used to verify that required tests or validations were performed (e.g., a policy proposal meets safety criteria) without revealing the underlying sensitive data, balancing transparency with confidentiality.

7.3 System Stability and Anti-Gaming

Measures are designed to maintain network health and prevent malicious actors from manipulating the system for selfish gain.

* Metric Gaming Prevention: The use of outlier trimming in data aggregation and balanced coherence criteria for rewards prevents agents from artificially inflating a single performance metric at the expense of overall system health.
* Thermodynamic Honesty (The Cheshire Constraint): A formal rule forbids the environment node (3) from short-circuiting directly to the mediator (C). This has a critical practical implication: agents cannot bypass physical embodiment or thermodynamic sinks. This constraint formally asserts that while XR can simulate embodiment, it cannot replace it; physical anchors remain mandatory for lawful cycles. This grounds the system's economic and ethical foundations in thermodynamic reality.

This design provides the theoretical blueprint for building a resilient prototype. The final section outlines the practical steps to begin development.

8.0 Prototype Implementation Specification

This final section provides a concrete, phased plan for developing a minimal viable prototype (MVP) of the Proof of Ethics agentic mesh as a software simulation.

8.1 Recommended Technology Stack

The following technology stack is proposed for the development of the software simulation:

* Language: Python, for its robust scientific computing libraries and rapid prototyping capabilities.
* Logic Simulation: Standard Python classes and enumerations will be used to implement agent state machines, operational modes, and lawfulness levels.
* Numerical Operations: NumPy or PyTorch will be used to handle the continuous, real-valued flows and performance metrics.
* Data Structures: Custom functions will be implemented for base-4 conversion and for simulating the carry-free operations of Modified Signed-Digit (MSD) arithmetic.

8.2 Key Module Interfaces

The initial development task is to define and freeze the data schemas for all inter-agent communication packets. This ensures interoperability from the outset. The following JSON schemas must be created:

* WorkUpdate.json (WU)
* HeatReport.json (HR)
* PolicyProposal.json (PP)
* CapabilityAttestation.json (CA)

A Core Schema Validator (CSV) module must be implemented. This module will be responsible for parsing and enforcing these schemas, validating all incoming data packets to ensure they conform to the protocol.

8.3 Phased Development Plan

A 12-week phased development plan is proposed for building the MVP.

1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Interface Definition. Finalize all packet schemas (WU, HR, PP, CA) and implement the Core Schema Validator (CSV) module. This establishes the communication backbone of the system.
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): C10 Sandbox Development. Simulate a single C10 cell containing 10 agents. The focus will be on implementing local learning cycles, merging Work Updates, and validating actions against the Quaternary Lawfulness protocol.
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9): C100 Cluster Extension. Combine multiple simulated C10 cells into a C100 cluster. Implement the protocols for representative rotation, outlier trimming of aggregated metrics, and quorum-based decision-making.
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12): C1000 Network Demonstration. Simulate a minimal C1000 network composed of several C100 clusters. The goal is to demonstrate high-level upgrade propagation from the network down to individual agents and test network-wide safety behaviors, such as the freeze/cooling mechanism in response to high strain.

This specification provides the necessary architectural blueprint to begin the development of a resilient, ethical, and scalable collective intelligence system, laying the groundwork for the Coherence Era.
